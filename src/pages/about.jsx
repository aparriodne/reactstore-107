            <p>Here at Phoenix Some say natural is the new normal but at Phoenix, there's nothing new about natural foods! Back in 2023, we opened our first store in an effort to make natural foods accessible to everyone. Up until then, grocers offering fresh, organic choices were either too expensive to shop or too hard to find. We wanted to be different! No more weaving through a maze of narrow aisles without anyone offering to help. No more ingredient lists featuring 40 unpronounceable chemicals. And most of all, no more spending an entire paycheck for food from the honest effort of a farmer not a factory.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            To us, being different is good!
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            People thought we were crazy when we wouldn't sell the country's top-selling sodas, snacks and candy. But we believed that eating clean and living healthy was more than just a trend. At Phoenix, it's our passion. And we knew that by focusing on farm-fresh produce and other healthy, affordable items, we could create a grocery experience where you didn't have to be wealthy to eat healthy!
            <br></br>
            So think of Phoenix as all of the very best parts of a real farmers market under one roof, open every day of the week. With our commitment to value in every department, and knowledgeable and friendly team members, we're confident that once you shop Phoenix you'll think different is good too.
            <br></br>
            Today we have grown to a store and atleast 1 team member . It's these individuals who are the key to our success. They're the ones who put good at the heart of everything we do at Phoenix â€¦ every day, in every community, with every guest. </p>
